        <h3>About the Group</h3>
        <p>The group uses first-principles density functional theory to calculate electronic structure, phonon structure, and magnon structure of novel materials that are useful for various applications: nanoelectronics, optoelectronics, spintronics, energy harvesting, and storage. We also study the surface and interfaces, searching electronic states that appear due to symmetry lowering and drive the exciting functionality not available in the bulk of the materials. This study's overarching goal is to understand the materials at the microscopic level and interactions that drive the mesoscale phenomena such as domains that appear in the ferroelectric and magnetic materials and use this understanding for materials design. The group collaborates with experimental groups around the world to develop a complete understanding of the material system. We are currently interested in studying complex oxide and their heterostructures, layered two-dimensional materials, and tunneling transport through them and Magnetic alloys.</p>
